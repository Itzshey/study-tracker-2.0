# study-tracker-2.0
## An app that tracks study sessions by marking tasks (To Do/Completed) and monitoring time spent!

-------------

REQUIREMENTS: 
The goal is to implement a to-do list where it is possible to:
- Register activity in the to-do list.
    The task must have:
      - Name
      - Description
      - Status: PENDING or COMPLETED
- You must be able to View:
  - list of pending tasks
  - list of completed tasks
  - list of tasks
  - Start the time of an activity directly from the to-do list view
 
------------

EXTRAS:
- Allow the user to start a task that already has time recorded previously.
    The new time should be added to the previous time and registered separately.
- When displaying the task, show additionally:
  - Total time spent.
  - Individual time intervals, if any.
